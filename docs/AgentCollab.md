# Agent Collaboration in Neurova City 🤝

Yo, let me tell you how our agents team up to make magic happen in the city! This isn't your regular boring meetings - we've got some seriously advanced collaboration going on.

## The Collab Magic ✨

When agents need to work together, they don't just jump in randomly. Our system's got this cool way of making sure the right agents connect at the right time:

### Smart Team Building 🎯

- We look at what kind of event we're dealing with
- Match agents based on their skills and past successes
- Make sure we've got the right mix of expertise
- Keep teams small but mighty (usually 5 agents max)

### Memory Matters 🧠

Every collaboration gets saved in our vector database with:

- Who was involved
- What they discussed
- How well they worked together
- What decisions they made

And get this - we can pull up similar past collaborations to help with new ones!

## How It Goes Down 🎬

### Round 1: The Setup

```
Event: "Emergency Response Planning"
Agents Selected: Safety Director (0.95 analytical),
                Urban Planner (0.9 creativity),
                Community Leader (0.95 empathy)
Status: Planning Phase 🎯
```

### Round 2: The Discussion

```
Messages flowing...
Decisions being made...
Consensus building...
Real-time updates keeping everyone in sync!
```

### Round 3: The Magic

- Agents share ideas (with some random cool encounters!)
