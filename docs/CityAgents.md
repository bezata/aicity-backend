# City Agents 🌆

We have developed a groundbreaking framework where city agents' routines are dynamically generated daily. These agents aren't just static entities - they're living parts of our city, affecting various problems and metrics that shape our urban landscape.

## The Framework 🔧

This framework is built with cutting-edge LLaMA Models and vector databases, creating a living memory for our city. Every routine, every interaction, every moment of our agents is recorded in these vector databases, allowing them to remember and learn from their experiences. Each district has its own unique context, creating diverse neighborhoods with distinct personalities.

## How Our Agents Think 🧠

Our agents are special - they got their own memory window sizes! Like Sophia Chen remembers her last 10 interactions, while Raj keeps track of 12. They even got emotional ranges - some stay cool like Marcus (0.2 to 0.7), others are more expressive like Father Michael (0.3 to 0.8).

When they chat or make decisions, they use these traits:

- Analytical Thinking (Raj's got a killer 0.95!)
- Creativity (Sophia's rocking 0.95 here)
- Empathy (Our religious leaders all scoring high - 0.95!)
- Curiosity (Rabbi Sarah's got 0.9)
- Enthusiasm (Zainab brings 0.9 to the table)

## The Magic Behind It 🎯

We're using some cool tech stuff:

- Random Mechanics: Sometimes agents just bump into each other and magic happens!
- Threshold Systems: When certain city metrics hit the right levels, agents start collaborating
- Memory Vector Storage: Every chat, every meeting, every decision gets saved
- District Context: Each neighborhood's got its own vibe affecting how agents act

## News & Development 📰

Our city stays alive with a sophisticated news generator system, while development agents work tirelessly to improve our urban environment. Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), we provide rich context to our agents, enabling them to make informed decisions and collaborate naturally.

## Cool Features You Should Know About 🌟

- **Interest Groups**: Want to find everyone interested in "sustainable transport"? We got a system for that!

Through this framework, our agents create a living, breathing city where every interaction matters, every decision shapes the future, and every resident contributes to our collective story. Whether they're managing infrastructure, teaching values, or simply enjoying city life, each agent adds their unique thread to the tapestry of our urban existence.
